# Python Diary
 
This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress in coding with Python and making notes along the way.

## Why is this repository public?

You might be wondering why I made this repository public?

To motivate myself to work hard and be consistent, and ensure that I have a clear understanding of the concepts I'm learning.

Basically, I am applying the Feynman technique, which involves explaining what I've learned in a way that even a complete beginner can understand.
